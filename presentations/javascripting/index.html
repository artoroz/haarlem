                            ### INTRODUCTION
                            To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.

                            Run this command to make a directory called `javascripting` (or something else if you like):

                            ```bash
                            mkdir javascripting
                            ```

                            Change directory into the `javascripting` folder:

                            ```bash
                            cd javascripting
                            ```

                            Create a file named `introduction.js`:

                            ```bash
                            touch introduction.js
                            ```

                            or if you're on windows,
                            ```bash
                            type NUL > introduction.js
                            ```
                            (`type` is part of the command!)

                            Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

                            ```js
                            console.log('hello');
                            ```

                            Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                            ```bash
                            javascripting verify introduction.js
                            ```

                            By the way, throughout this tutorial, you can give the file you work with any name you like, so if you want to use something like `catsAreAwesome.js` file for every exercise, you can do that. Just make sure to run:

                            ```bash
                            javascripting verify catsAreAwesome.js
                            ```
                        </script>
                    </section>

                            ### YOU DID IT!

                            Anything between the parentheses of `console.log()` are printed to the terminal.

                            So this:

                            ```js
                            console.log('hello');
                            ```

                            prints `hello` to the terminal.

                            Currently we are printing a **string** of characters to the terminal: `hello`.

                            In the next challenge we focus on learning about **variables**.

                            Run `javascripting` in the console to choose the next challenge.

                            ### VARIABLES
                            A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are declared using `var` followed by the variable's name.

                            Here's an example:

                            ```js
                            var example;
                            ```

                            The above variable is **declared**, but it isn't defined (it does not yet reference a specific value).

                            Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific value:

                            ```js
                            var example = 'some string';
                            ```

                            # NOTE

                            A variable is **declared** using `var` and uses the equals sign to **define** the value that it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable equal a value".

                            ## The challenge:

                            Create a file named `variables.js`.

                            In that file declare a variable named `example`.

                            **Make the variable `example` equal to the value `'some string'`.**

                            Then use `console.log()` to print the `example` variable to the console.

                            Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                            `javascripting verify variables.js`

                        </script>

                            In the next challenge we will look at strings more closely.

                            ### STRINGS

                            A **string** is any value surrounded by quotes.

                            It can be single or double quotes:

                            ```js
                            'this is a string'

                            "this is also a string"
                            ```

                            ## NOTE

                            Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotes.

                            ## The challenge:

                            For this challenge, create a file named `strings.js`.

                            In that file create a variable named `someString` like this:

                            ```js
                            var someString = 'this is a string';
                            ```

                            Use `console.log` to print the variable **someString** to the terminal.

                            Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                            `javascripting verify strings.js`

                        </script>

                        ### STRING LENGTH
                        You will often need to know how many characters are in a string.

                        For this you will use the `.length` property. Here's an example:

                        ```js
                        var example = 'example string';
                        example.length
                        ```

                        ## NOTE

                        Make sure there is a period between `example` and `length`.

                        The above code will return a **number** for the total number of characters in the string.


                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `string-length.js`.

                        In that file, create a variable named `example`.

                        **Assign the string `'example string'` to the variable `example`.**

                        Use `console.log` to print the **length** of the string to the terminal.

                        **Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

                        `javascripting verify string-length.js`

                        ### REVISING STRINGS
                        You will often need to change the contents of a string.

                        Strings have built-in functionality that allow you to inspect and manipulate their contents.

                        Here is an example using the `.replace()` method:

                        ```js
                        var example = 'this example exists';
                        example = example.replace('exists', 'is awesome');
                        console.log(example);
                        ```

                        Note that to change the value that the `example` variable references, we need
                        to use the equals sign again, this time with the `example.replace()` method to
                        the right of the equals sign.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `revising-strings.js`.

                        Define a variable named `pizza` that references this string: `'pizza is alright'`

                        Use the `.replace()` method to change `alright` to `wonderful`.

                        Use `console.log()` to print the results of the `.replace()` method to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        `javascripting verify revising-strings.js`

                        ### NUMBERS
                        Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.

                        In those instances you will use the `.toString()` method. Here's an example:

                        ```js
                        var n = 256;
                        n = n.toString();
                        ```

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `number-to-string.js`.

                        In that file define a variable named `n` that references the number `128`;

                        Call the `.toString()` method on the `n` variable.

                        Use `console.log()` to print the results of the `.toString()` method to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify number-to-string.js
                        ```

                        ### ROUNDING NUMBERS
                        We can do basic math using familiar operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

                        For more complex math, we can use the `Math` object.

                        In this challenge we'll use the `Math` object to round numbers.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `rounding-numbers.js`.

                        In that file define a variable named `roundUp` that references the float `1.5`.

                        We will use the `Math.round()` method to round the number up. This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

                        An example of using `Math.round()`:

                        ```js
                        Math.round(0.5);
                        ```

                        Define a second variable named `rounded` that references the output of the `Math.round()` method, passing in the `roundUp` variable as the argument.

                        Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify rounding-numbers.js
                        ```

                        ### NUMBER TO STRING
                        Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.

                        In those instances you will use the `.toString()` method. Here's an example:

                        ```js
                        var n = 256;
                        n = n.toString();
                        ```

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `number-to-string.js`.

                        In that file define a variable named `n` that references the number `128`;

                        Call the `.toString()` method on the `n` variable.

                        Use `console.log()` to print the results of the `.toString()` method to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ### IF STATEMENT
                        Conditional statements are used to alter the control flow of a program, based on a specified boolean condition.

                        A conditional statement looks like this:

                        ```js
                        if (n > 1) {
                          console.log('the variable n is greater than 1.');
                        } else {
                          console.log('the variable n is less than or equal to 1.');
                        }
                        ```

                        Inside parentheses you must enter a logic statement, meaning that the result of the statement is either true or false.

                        The else block is optional and contains the code that will be executed if the statement is false.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `if-statement.js`.

                        In that file, declare a variable named `fruit`.

                        Make the `fruit` variable reference the value **orange** with the type of **String**.

                        Then use `console.log()` to print "**The fruit name has more than five characters."** if the length of the value of `fruit` is greater than five.
                        Otherwise, print "**The fruit name has five characters or less.**"

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash

                        ### FOR LOOP
                        For loops look like this:

                        ```js
                        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                          // log the numbers 0 through 9
                          console.log(i)
                        }
                        ```

                        The variable `i` is used to track how many times the loop has run.

                        The statement `i < 10;` indicates the limit of the loop.
                        It will continue to loop if `i` is less than `10`.

                        The statement `i++` increases the variable `i` by 1 each loop.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `for-loop.js`.

                        In that file define a variable named `total` and make it equal the number `0`.

                        Define a second variable named `limit` and make it equal the number `10`.

                        Create a for loop with a variable `i` starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each time through the loop. The loop should run as long as `i` is less than `limit`.

                        On each iteration of the loop, add the number `i` to the `total` variable. To do this, you can use this statement:

                        ```js
                        total += i;
                        ```

                        After the for loop, use `console.log()` to print the `total` variable to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash

                        ```js
                        var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];

                        In that file define a variable named `pizzaToppings` that references an array that contains three strings in this order: `tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni`.

                        Use `console.log()` to print the `pizzaToppings` array to the terminal.

                        ### ARRAY FILTERING
                        There are many ways to manipulate arrays.

                        One common task is filtering arrays to only contain certain values.

                        For this we can use the `.filter()` method.

                        Here is an example:

                        ```js
                        var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant'];

                        var filtered = pets.filter(function (pet) {
                          return (pet !== 'elephant');
                        });
                        ```

                        The `filtered` variable will now only contain `cat` and `dog`.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `array-filtering.js`.

                        In that file, define a variable named `numbers` that references this array:

                        ```js
                        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
                        ```

                        Like above, define a variable named `filtered` that references the result of `numbers.filter()`.

                        The function that you pass to the `.filter()` method will look something like this:

                        ```js
                        function evenNumbers (number) {
                          return number % 2 === 0;
                        }
                        ```

                        Use `console.log()` to print the `filtered` array to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash

                        ### ACCESSING ARRAY VALUES
                        Array elements can be accessed through index number.

                        Index number starts from zero to array's property length minus one.

                        Here is an example:


                        ```js
                        var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];

                        console.log(pets[0]);
                        ```

                        The above code will print the first element of `pets` array - string `cat`.

                        Array elements must be accessed through only using bracket notation.

                        Dot notation is invalid.

                        Valid notation:

                        ```js
                        console.log(pets[0]);
                        ```

                        Invalid notation:
                        ```
                        console.log(pets.1);
                        ```

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `accessing-array-values.js`.

                        In that file, define array `food` :
                        ```js
                        var food = ['apple', 'pizza', 'pear'];
                        ```


                        Use `console.log()` to print the `second` value of array to the terminal.

                        ### LOOPING THROUGH ARRAYS
                        For this challenge we will use a **for loop** to access and manipulate a list of values in an array.

                        Accessing array values can be done using an integer.

                        Each item in an array is identified by a number, starting at `0`.

                        So in this array `hi` is identified by the number `1`:

                        ```js
                        var greetings = ['hello', 'hi', 'good morning'];
                        ```

                        It can be accessed like this:

                        ```js
                        greetings[1];
                        ```

                        So inside a **for loop** we would use the `i` variable inside the square brackets instead of directly using an integer.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `looping-through-arrays.js`.

                        In that file, define a variable named `pets` that references this array:

                        ```js
                        ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];
                        ```

                        Create a for loop that changes each string in the array so that they are plural.

                        You will use a statement like this inside the for loop:

                        ```js
                        pets[i] = pets[i] + 's';
                        ```

                        After the for loop, use `console.log()` to print the `pets` array to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify looping-through-arrays.js
                        ```

                        Now all the items in that `pets` array are plural!

                        In the next challenge we will move from arrays to working with **objects**.

                        ### OBJECTS
                        Objects are lists of values similar to arrays, except values are identified by keys instead of integers.

                        Here is an example:

                        ```js
                        var foodPreferences = {
                          pizza: 'yum',
                          salad: 'gross'
                        };
                        ```

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `objects.js`.

                        In that file, define a variable named `pizza` like this:

                        ```js
                        var pizza = {
                          toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],
                          crust: 'deep dish',
                          serves: 2
                        };
                        ```

                        Use `console.log()` to print the `pizza` object to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify objects.js
                        ```

                        ### OBJECT PROPERTIES
                        You can access and manipulate object properties –– the keys and values that an object contains –– using a method very similar to arrays.

                        Here's an example using **square brackets**:

                        ```js
                        var example = {
                          pizza: 'yummy'
                        };

                        console.log(example['pizza']);
                        ```

                        The above code will print the string `'yummy'` to the terminal.

                        Alternately, you can use **dot notation** to get identical results:

                        ```js
                        example.pizza;

                        example['pizza'];
                        ```

                        The two lines of code above will both return `yummy`.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `object-properties.js`.

                        In that file, define a variable named `food` like this:

                        ```js
                        var food = {
                          types: 'only pizza'
                        };
                        ```

                        Use `console.log()` to print the `types` property of the `food` object to the terminal.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify object-properties.js
                        ```

                        ### FUNCTIONS
                        A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and then produces output.

                        Here is an example:

                        ```js
                        function example (x) {
                          return x * 2;
                        }
                        ```

                        We can **call** that function like this to get the number 10:

                        ```js
                        example(5)
                        ```

                        The above example assumes that the `example` function will take a number as an argument –– as input –– and will return that number multiplied by 2.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `functions.js`.

                        In that file, define a function named `eat` that takes an argument named `food`
                        that is expected to be a string.

                        Inside the function return the `food` argument like this:

                        ```js
                        return food + ' tasted really good.';
                        ```

                        Inside of the parentheses of `console.log()`, call the `eat()` function with the string `bananas` as the argument.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify functions.js
                        ```

                        ### FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
                        A function can be declared to receive any number of arguments. Arguments can be from any type. An argument could be a string, a number, an array, an object and even another function.

                        Here is an example:

                        ```js
                        function example (firstArg, secondArg) {
                          console.log(firstArg, secondArg);
                        }
                        ```

                        We can **call** that function with two arguments like this:

                        ```js
                        example('hello', 'world');
                        ```

                        The above example will print to the terminal `hello world`.

                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `function-arguments.js`.

                        In that file, define a function named `math` that takes three arguments. It's important for you to understand that arguments names are only used to reference them.

                        Name each argument as you like.

                        Within the `math` function, return the value obtained from multiplying the second and third arguments and adding that result to the first argument.

                        After that, inside the parentheses of `console.log()`, call the `math()` function with the number `53` as first argument, the number `61` as second and the number `67` as third argument.

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify function-arguments.js
                        ```

                        ### SCOPE
                        `Scope` is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.

                        JavaScript has two scopes: `global` and `local`. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a `global` variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program. A variable that is declared inside a function definition is `local`. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function.

                        Functions defined inside other functions, known as nested functions, have access to their parent function's scope.

                        Pay attention to the comments in the code below:

                        ```js
                        var a = 4;	// a is a global variable, it can be accessed by the functions below

                        function foo() {
                        	var b = a * 3;	// b cannot be accessed outside foo function, but can be accessed by functions
                        					// defined inside foo
                        	function bar(c) {
                        	var b = 2;  // another `b` variable is created inside bar function scope
                        				// the changes to this new `b` variable don't affect the old `b` variable
                        	console.log( a, b, c );
                        	}

                        	bar(b * 4);
                        }

                        foo(); // 4, 2, 48
                        ```
                        IIFE, Immediately Invoked Function Expression, is a common pattern for creating local scopes
                        example:
                        ```js
                        	(function(){ // the function expression is surrounded by parenthesis
                        		// variables defined here
                        		// can't be accessed outside
                        	})(); // the function is immediately invoked
                        ```
                        ## The challenge:

                        Create a file named `scope.js`.

                        In that file, copy the following code:
                        ```js
                        var a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

                        (function firstFunction(){
                        	var b = 5, c = 6;

                        	(function secondFunction(){
                        		var b = 8;

                        		(function thirdFunction(){
                        			var a = 7, c = 9;

                        			(function fourthFunction(){
                        				var a = 1, c = 8;

                        			})();
                        		})();
                        	})();
                        })();
                        ```

                        Use your knowledge of the variables' `scope` and place the following code inside one of the functions in `scope.js`
                        so the output is `a: 1, b: 8,c: 6`
                        ```js
                        console.log("a: "+a+", b: "+b+", c: "+c);
                        ```

                        Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

                        ```bash
                        javascripting verify scope.js
